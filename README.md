Most Simple Building Energy Model
For students and teachers to learn or teach about buildings physics and buildings energy simulation.
The objective is to make available a very simple dynamic building energy model (for heating and cooling) understandable with a minimum knowledge in buildings physics and numerical analysis.

The model, inspire from Berthou et al. 2014 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778814000760), can be used as a medium to introduce:

•	Impact of water on energy consumption

•	Impact of occupancy on energy consumption

•	Building model as an assessment tool for building retrofit, awareness campaign and smart heating control

In the future, case studies on model parameters identification and Model Predictive Control should be added
